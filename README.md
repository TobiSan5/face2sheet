**Introduction**

This project is a fork of Sketchup extension GitHub source tav/wikihouse-plugin, which hasn't been updated since 2013. Its status is currently at ideation. Within the original project, there are supposedly algorithms to unfold and layout Wikihouse component faces unto plywood (or similar) sheet dimensions, for CNC routing. A extension with this capability would generally be of value for SU users who want to design for CNC.

**Goals**
- [ ] A simpified extension which can be installed offer basic functionality for CNC layout
- [ ] A user interface to change parameters, like, for instance, sheet material size
- [ ] An optimized algorithm for the face layout which waste a minimum of sheet material

**Resources**

Similar functionality has been made before in other projects, noteably by renowned extension developer ThomThom, by who I found "Milling Tools" on the Extension Warehouse. By inspection, he has also forked the original project, around the year 2013.
